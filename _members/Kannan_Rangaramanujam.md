- Specializing in translational nanomedicine, research focuses on a unique hydroxyl dendrimer platform for targeting injured glia/macrophages. This approach aims to develop therapies for various disorders, supported by patents, publications, and NIH funding. Affiliations with AIMBE and the NSF CAREER award led to co-founding Ashvattha Therapeutics Inc., advancing dendrimer technologies with promising results in severe COVID patients.
